Universal Aicrete Mixer Assembly instructions

 Pull major parts of UAM out of truck bed or trailer.

Place leg unit in operating area and lift lower tank shell into place.

Place auger assembly into lower tank shell. 

Fit bolts into bearing mounting plate holes. Check alignment of auger flights with bottom and sides of lower tank shell with spacer shims and then tighten bearing plate mounting bolts. 

Fit gasket on tank shell flange, keeping hole cutouts aligned. 

Place upper tank shell into place. 

Fit chain around mixer and transfer pump sprockets. 

Use flat blade screwdriver or small pin bar to align holes. Be careful to not damage gasket. 

Fit bolts loosely into tank shell flange bolt holes and once all are in loosely, snug them in a “star pattern” so the flanges seat the gasket well. 

Bolt transfer piping flanges together in 2 places: pump discharge location (discharge line) and tank top location (recirc line).  

Bolt power transmission mounting plate to motor bench, fitting gear reduction shaft coupling to coupling on auger shaft.

Bolt foam generator to front bench. Foam generator consists of water transfer pump, water manifold, air manifold, and foam chamber (3” pipe with steel wool). 

Connect water line from fresh water tank and premixed soapy water tank to the water manifold. 

Bolt air compressor to front bench. Connect compressor air discharge line to air manifold. 

Connect foam generator discharge line to mixing vessel connection via 2” camloc. 

Connect material transfer hose to pump discharge. 

Test run the mixer/pump: Make sure the transfer valves are open. Make sure workers are clear of machine and turn the motor on to see if the auger and pump are turning freely and machine looks and sounds OK. You are looking for any excess shaking or vibration. You are listening for excess scraping or unusual noises. Note: Starting the machine is the most important time to pay attention to it. 

      Leaving the recirc valve open, close the discharge valve. Pour 5 gallons of fresh water into the mixer and recirculate only. Check for rate out of the recirc line discharge location at the top of the mixing vessel and listen for noises that would indicate an obstruction. Watch the discharge pressure gauge as that will also signal a problem by showing excess “backpressure” (discharge pressure the transfer pump is working against). 

If the machine looks and sounds OK recirculating the 5 gallons of water, put in 7 more gallons. You are now ready to mix aircrete.
