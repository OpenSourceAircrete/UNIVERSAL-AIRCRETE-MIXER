# Open Source Low-Rate NAAC Equipment

## Project Overview

This repository contains a collection of open-source equipment designs and building systems for **Low-Rate Non-Autoclaved Aerated Concrete (NAAC)**, also known as cellular concrete. In this context, "low-rate" refers to production volumes suitable for small construction crews, on-demand applications, or DIY projects, as opposed to large-scale industrial manufacturing.

The primary focus is on developing modular, portable, and low-volume mixing equipment. The designs are ideal for "dry bag" operations and robust enough for **rental fleets**. These systems are intended for community-driven development and collaboration.

## Equipment Designs

The following designs are available for use, modification, and further development. They are listed in order of development priority.

### 1. "Half Pipe" Ribbon Mixer

A modular and lightweight cellular concrete mixer designed for scalability and ease of use.

* **Key Features:**
    * **Contraflow Mixing System:** Features inner and outer ribbon augers rotating in opposite directions (approx. 60 RPM) to ensure thorough and rapid homogenization of the material.
    * **Clean Mixing Chamber:** The outer auger is equipped with rubber wipers on its flights to keep the mixer walls clean and prevent material buildup.
    * **Scalable Volume:** The mixing capacity can be easily scaled by adjusting the length of the mixer.
    * **Adaptable Power:** Can be adapted to various power transmission systems, with a hydraulic setup recommended for its versatility in powering auxiliary equipment.

### 2. "RecirC" Mixer

A modular and portable cellular concrete mixer constructed from 10-gauge steel plate and 1/8" angle iron.

* **Key Features:**
    * **Integrated Material Lift:** Eliminates the need for a separate transfer pump to move the concrete into wall forms, simplifying the on-site workflow.
    * **Low-Speed Operation:** Operates at approximately 30 RPM, an ideal speed for delicate cellular concrete mixtures.
    * **Portable Design:** Engineered for on-site portability and ease of use.

### 3. "Cloud Inhaler" Dust Reducer

A venturi-based device designed to mitigate airborne dust around concrete mixing equipment.

* **Key Features:**
    * **Enhanced Safety:** Improves on-site safety and creates a cleaner working environment.
    * **Simple & Effective:** A straightforward design for easy implementation with existing mixing setups.
    * **Adaptable:** Engineered for simplicity, making it suitable for use across disparate industries where dust control is a concern.
