# Open Source Aircrete Production Equipment

## Project Overview

*Please donate to the GofundMe* https://www.gofundme.com/f/aircrete-is-awesome?lid=wmmfu28o9xfl

*Here's some research I authored regarding regulatory approval for aircrete. https://www.ijrtmr.com/archives/paper-details?paperid=217&papertitle=the-road-to-regulatory-approval-for-monolithic-pour-naac-residential-structures

This repository contains a collection of open-source equipment designs  to produce **Non-Autoclaved Aerated Concrete (NAAC)**, also known as cellular concrete, or "aircrete". https://www.designingbuildings.co.uk/wiki/Aircrete In this context, "low-rate" refers to production volumes suitable for small construction crews constructing or repairing parts of a single home.

The primary focus is on developing modular, portable, and low-volume mixing and pumping equipment. The designs are ideal for "dry bag" mixing operations. To clarify, a "dry bag" mixer performs two critical steps in NAAC production: mixing a Portland cement slurry, and mixing stable foam into that slurry to create NAAC material. This equipment should be robust enough for rental fleets. These designs are intended for community-driven development and collaboration.

It is the designer's belief that NAAC is an ideal residential building material that has been held back by expensive mixing equipment. Ai. There's never been good small contractor grade equipment, with the cheapest good mixers costing $50,000+. The UAM BOM is estimated to be less than $5,000. The two key design features that allow this is the use of 3mm (10 guage) plate and 1/8" tubing in place of 5mm and 1/4" steel and tubing. The designer proved with the alpha protoype that this lighter material is suitable for mixing an end product with a density of 0.6-0.8 (relative to H2O). Reinforced cement concrete, for reference exhibits a 2.4 density. 

*This is exactly what we need the machine to do and an example of the cheapest/best home that can be built.* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfUKHgh9K9g

The mixers have been designed with integrated transfer pumps made from mild steel solid augers. This is a low tech/high capability setup that saves thousands on the BOM. 

A small venturi dust extraction system should shield operators from excessive cement dust. 

Designer's note on the challenges this machine faces: There are three crucial processes a machine like this performs. First it needs to mix a Portland cement slurry. Then it needs to mix in stable foam to produce the NAAC material. Then it needs to transfer the NAAC material out of the machine and over a lightweight wall form. The challenge is this: the first evolution requires "shear force" to properly mix the slurry and hydrate the Portland cement properly. The second and third evolutions must avoid shear force, instead relying on laminar flow to avoid damaging the stable foam. The use of the transfer pump plays a crucial role in this. Manipulating the two 3" "recirculation and discharge" system ball valves to create backpressure should help to shear the slurry. Once the stable foam is starting to be injected the operator will upen the valves wide and eliminate the shear.

## Equipment Designs

The following designs are available for use, modification, and further development. They are listed in order of development priority.

### 1. "Tin Can" Ribbon Mixer and integrated recirculating and transfer pump. 

A modular and lightweight cellular concrete mixer designed for scalability and ease of use.

* **Key Features:**
  * **Ribbon Auger Mixing System:** Features songle ribbon auger (rotating approx. 60 RPM) to ensure thorough and rapid homogenization of the material. The positive recirculating pump assists in mixing effectively lowering the demand on the auger ribbons.
  * **Integrated Solid Impeller Recirculating and Transfer Pump** A "low shear" transfer pump is needed to lift the fully mixed NAAC 4M. That's the expected height of a single story wall forms. The solid impeller, positive displacement transfer pump is also turning at 40-50 RPMS. If NAAC is required to be pumped to a second story the machine should be set up there. 
  * **Clean Mixing Chamber:** The outer auger flight is equipped with rubber wipers on its flights to keep the mixer walls clean and prevent material buildup.
  * **Scalable Volume:** The mixing capacity can be easily scaled by adjusting the length of the mixer's final dimensions.
  * **Adaptable Power:** Can be adapted to various power transmission systems, with a hydraulic setup recommended for its versatility in powering auxiliary equipment and suitability for low RPM operation. 
  * **Portable Design:** Engineered for on-site portability and ease of use. Quick assembly and disassembly allows this machine to be loaded and unloaded out of the back of a standard pickup truck with no overhead lifting gear or a forklift. As such it doesn't need to be traillered. This level of portability as it lowers cost and increases access.

* **Recommended Modifications** This design can be easily modified to save costs in two ways: 1.Upper mixer shell can be fabricated as straight sides rather than a curve. This might result in a decrease in mixing effeciency as the can shape forces the material against the auger flights. 2. Transfer pump can be eliminated. This limits the machine's practicality in almost any operational environment but saves cost on the parts required to build the pump. In a small blockmaking setting transfer pumps seem to be seldom used so this might prove to be popular.
